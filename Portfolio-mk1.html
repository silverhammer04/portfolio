            <h2 >A Short and Simple Biography</h2>
            <p>Graduated from Copper Hills High School in 04.  Enlisted into the United States Marine Corps in 08.  Did 4 years of active duty, and 4 years inactive ready reserve.  I worked with a family friend at Soda Tech.(if you need a small fountain machine I know a guy)  Started working with Elwood Staffing, they sent me to Luxul warehouse.  Luxul is a small local tech company.  Luxul gets sold to Legrand, and they close the warehouse in 2019.  So I go back to Elwood, and between inconsistent work and bad experiences, I decide to get an education.</p>

        <h2 id="fact">Factoids</h2>
            <p>I'm quiet, I'm trying to control how I react to the stupid drivers on the road.  I also wanted some word salad to pad things out a bit more.  I do not want to make more unorded lists for this project.</p>
            <p>I like music. Have you ever heard of the band Jinjer?  One of the best things about them, the videos of people reacting to Jinjer.<a class="jinjer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQNtGoM3FVU">JINJER - Pisces (Live Session) | Napalm Records</a> Watch the original video, then the reactions. </p>
